# Uber 2014 Trip Data Analysis
This project analyses multiple sets of data (from the year 2014) containing the location of Uber vehicles at different times and dates. These datasets include useful information such as the longitude and latitude of each vehicle when picking up a customer.

The data will need to be manipulated in such a way that allows for this type of analysis.

## Aim of Project
Using Python with Jupiter notebooks, this project is aimed at extracting and comparing graphical information to ultimately determine:

1. What are the most popular days and times for people riding with Uber?
2. Where are the majority of Uber customers being picked up from?

## How to View Project Results
I have included all of my Jupiter notebooks along with the original datasets on github, but you can view the presented analysis on my portfolio by clicking on the following link:<br />
